We offer comprehensive audio post-production services, which include careful selection of microphones and alternative takes, synchronization, editing, frequency correction, and equalization, with the aim of achieving high-quality sound material.

Recording and editing dialogue:
-- This includes voice recording (non-sync), synchronization, editing, and sound leveling of the dialogue. Our experts will ensure that the dialogue is recorded and processed to sound clear and high-quality.

ADR - (Automated Dialogue Replacement) or field dialogue re-recording:
-- In case the sound quality on location is not good or if background noise dominates the dialogue, we offer the possibility of ADR or dialogue re-recording. This provides a clean and clear sound that will enhance the quality of your production.

Foley effects and sound design:
-- Our sound specialists will perform recording, selection, and synchronization of synchronous and asynchronous Foley effects. They will also create and build a sound design for each individual scene, adding additional atmosphere and emotion to your production.

Music:
