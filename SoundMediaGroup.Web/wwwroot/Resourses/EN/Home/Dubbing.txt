Dubbing for television and film productions: Our equipment and talented actors are at your disposal for voice dubbing in television and film projects. We combine virtuoso performances with synchronization precision to ensure high-quality dubbing.

Voiceover: The price for voiceover is determined based on the minutes of dubbed time and depends on several factors:
-- Number of actors: The price is determined according to the number of actors required for the project.
-- Translators: If translation of the text is needed, the price includes the services of translators.
-- Sound director and studio time: The costs of a professional sound director and the time allocated in the studio are included.

Lip-sync dubbing: The price for lip-sync dubbing is determined based on the minutes of dubbed time and is specially tailored to the exact editing of the text. The text must correspond to the number of words, syllables, and sounds performed by the actor. The price includes the work of the sound director in synchronizing the words with the audio-visual recording.

Our goal is to provide you with exceptional professional dubbing services that are fully tailored to your unique project and requirements. We strive for the highest quality and professionalism in every aspect of our work, with special attention to detail.
